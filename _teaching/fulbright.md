Was selected for the [Fulbright Scholarship](https://fulbrightscholars.org/what-fulbright/fulbright-scholar-program), a prestigious and long-standing federal program designed to boost diplomatic exchange and international education. Every year, a cohort of researchers and educators are sent to disseminate American values and culture, either teaching English or by conducting research on various topics.

As part of the 2026 Cohort, one of only a [handful from Columbia University](https://urf.columbia.edu/news/columbia-graduates-and-alums-awarded-fulbright-us-student-grants-2025-2026), I will work in a grade school in rural South Korea, learning to navigate new environments, solve difficult and ambiguous problems, and increase my own understanding of the societies that make up the world.
