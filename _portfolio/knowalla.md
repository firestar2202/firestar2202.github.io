During my Spring 2025 internship at **Knowalla Inc**, I focused on improving the accuracy and robustness of the platform’s AI solver evaluation framework.  

- Designed and implemented a new faithfulness evaluation pipeline, boosting solver accuracy from **36–60%** to **78–93%**.  
- Identified critical weaknesses in the existing testing system and introduced **quantitative benchmarks** for a more rigorous assessment of AI-generated solutions.  

This work ensured that students using the platform receive more **reliable, factually consistent answers** and set the foundation for future large-scale improvements in automated grading and solver feedback.
