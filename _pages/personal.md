I'm linking my blog, some photography I've done, and some news articles about me, in case you want to get to know a little about me outside of my academics! Feel free to follow my substack if you want to learn about my travels in Korea, my experience going from a Math&CS student to an English teacher, or just to stay in touch.

## Writing & Photography
- [My Substack](https://substack.com/@firestar2202?utm_campaign=profile&utm_medium=profile-page) â€” essays and reflections on education, identity, culture, and general ramblings.

- Some of my favorite shots:
