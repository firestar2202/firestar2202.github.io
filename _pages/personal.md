I'm also a blogger! I've shared it here in case you want to learn about my travels in Korea, my experience going from a Math&CS student to an English teacher, or just to look at my photography. I'm also including some other news mentions about me too, mostly about my fencing.

## Writing & Photography
- [My Substack](https://substack.com/@firestar2202?utm_campaign=profile&utm_medium=profile-page) â€” essays and reflections on education, identity, culture, and general ramblings.

- Some of my favorite shots:
