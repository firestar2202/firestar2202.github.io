Hi! My name is Justin Haddad. I recently graduated from Columbia University with a degree in Mathematics & Computer Science, and I'll be beginning my journey as a Fulbright ETA to South Korea in January 2026!

Iâ€™m passionate about teaching, language exchange, sociology, different cultures, technology, robotics, mathematics, and any intersection of these! I believe the best ideas are ones that can combine thinking from different, unlikely sources. 

Outside of academics, I am a competitive fencer and 2025 individual Ivy League Champion. I love reading, writing, photography, working out, playing games, and learning new things.
