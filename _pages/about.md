Hi, I’m Justin Haddad. I recently graduated from Columbia University with a degree in Mathematics & Computer Science.  
I’m passionate about everything from teaching, technology, sociology, cultural exchange, robotics, mathematics, and language! 

Outside of academics, I was a competitive fencer and Ivy League Champion, and I’ll soon be heading to South Korea as a Fulbright ETA.
