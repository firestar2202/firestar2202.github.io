Hi, I’m Justin Haddad. 

I recently graduated from Columbia University with a degree in Mathematics & Computer Science, and I'll be beginning my journey as a Fulbright ETA to South Korea in January 2026!

I’m passionate about everything from teaching, culture and language exchange, sociology, technology, robotics, mathematics, and any intersection of these! I believe the best ideas are ones that can combine thinking from different, unlikely sources. 

Outside of academics, I was a competitive fencer and Ivy League Champion. I love reading, writing, photography, working out, playing games, and learning new things.
