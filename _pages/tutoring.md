I can tutor a wide variety of Elementary, Middle, High School, and College level mathematics: Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1, Geometry, Algebra 2, Trigonometry, Pre-calculus, Single Variable Calculus, Multi Variable Calculus, and Linear Algebra. I can also tutor students specifically towards school exams or mathematical standardized testing: Common core math, **SAT math portion, SAT Subject tests Math 1 & Math 2, ACT Math portion, and AP Calculus for both AB and BC**. I believe there are test-taking skills that can be learned to drastically improve scores that anyone can learn, even those who don't believe they are necessarily "*mathematically inclined*". 

I have been tutoring part time since 2021 with various students ranging from Elementary to College level in many types of mathematics, helping improve GPAs and SAT scores. I like to teach mathematics because I think the subject can be beautifuly and fun, and I feel extremely gratified when I can help someone understand and even enjoy the subjects even more. I try to put myself in the shoes of every different student I have to see the gaps in their understanding, and eventually seal them up. 

I personally scored perfect **800/800 on both the SAT math portion**, as well as the SAT Subject test Math 2, **as well as 5â€™s** on the AP Calculus, AP Computer Science, and AP Physics. I graduated from Columbia University with a B.S. in Math and Computer Science with **Dean's List Honors 3.9 GPA**, and from the Montgomery Blair High School STEM Magnet program with a 4.0 GPA. I was awarded the Academic All-American honors for my performance as a student-athlete, the third fencer in Columbia University history to receive the national award. 

I wish to help students as much as possible, so I welcome any school resources or suggestions students or parents can provide. ***I am easy to reach and I respond quickly, just send me an email at: <a href="#" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText('jhaddad2202@gmail.com'); alert('Email copied!'); return false;">
